# Math C Library

A comprehensive collection of mathematical functions and algorithms implemented in C. This repository is organized into specific domains of mathematics, ranging from basic algebra to advanced number theory and stereometry.

Project Structure

The project is modularly organized to make it easy to find specific mathematical implementations:

* **Algebra**: Algebraic operations and equations.
* **Analytical Geometry**: Coordinate-based geometry.
* **Counting**: Combinatorics, including permutations and combinations.
* **Geometry**: 2D geometric calculations (area, perimeter, etc.).
* **Stereometry**: 3D geometry and spatial calculations.
* **Number Theory**: Algorithms for primes, divisors, and modular arithmetic.
* **Global_Funcs**: Common utility functions used across multiple modules.
* **Constants.h**: Constants used throughout the program.
